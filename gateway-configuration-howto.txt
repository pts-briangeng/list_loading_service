GATEWAY CONFIGURATION
======================

So that offers service works with the LCP, you'll need a few things first. The reason for this is because:
   * Users making a request to a service through the gateway must have the appropriate permissions
   	 through permissionsets. Permissionsets must be created granting access.
   * The gateway must know how to route requests to the service through its onboard HAProxy load balancer.


Setting up Gateway on FT, Staging, Production
======================================================
Ops must add configure HAProxy on the gateway instances to route
localhost:1300 to the HOST:PORT of the offers service deployment.


Integrating with Platform using platforms 'test_deploy' Vagrant bootup
======================================================================

1) Setup an offers service on your host running on port 1300. Port 1300 is just a default,
you can choose to run it on any host/port as you'll see in one of the next steps.

If you don't have an offers service ready yet, this bash command will do:
$ while true; do echo -e 'HTTP/1.0 201 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nLocation: blah\nContent-Length: 20\n\n{"offers": "works!"}' | nc -l -p 1300 -q 1; done

2) startup the vagrant based lcp:
<platform-src-directory>$ paver test_deploy
When this finishes you'll have the LCP running and available at http://web.lcp/

3) Enable gateway routing to the offers service:
<offers-src-directory>$ ./enable_offers.sh
# if your offers service is running somewhere other than your host machine on 1300
<offers-src-directory>$ ./enable_offers SOME_OTHER_HOST:SOME_OTHER_PORT

4) Only applications can create offers. Since the GW now manages access to the offers service, you'll need an application.

a) create an account:
<platform-src-directory>$ ./lcp/gateway/lcp_curl.py -X POST -d '{"email": "test@points.com"}' http://sandbox.lcp/accounts/

b) using the account credentials from step (a), create an App:
<platform-src-directory>$ ./lcp/gateway/lcp_curl.py -X POST -d '{"name": "tst", "description": "tst"}' -u "ACCOUNT_MAC_ID:ACCOUNT_MAC_SECRET" http://sandbox.lcp/apps/

c) get your sandbox credentials (yes these steps are a pain):
<platform-src-directory>$ ./lcp/gateway/lcp_curl.py -X GET -u"ACCOUNT_MAC_ID:ACCOUNT_MAC_SECRET" http://sandbox.lcp/apps/APP-ID/sandbox-credentials/CRED-ID

5) See that the gateway sends POST requests to the offers service:
<platform-src-directory>./lcp/gateway/lcp_curl.py -X POST -d '{}' -u "APP_MAC_ID:APP_MAC_SECRET" http://sandbox.lcp/offers/
